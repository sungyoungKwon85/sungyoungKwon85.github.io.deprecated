# IPython Notebook?  
- `I` means `interactive`  
- `IPython Notebook` is an empty note which can check the data by Python and see the results quickly there  
- `Jupyter` has IPython 3.x version as well as other languages

# Why Jupyter?  
- We enter commands and see the outputs  
- Jupyter makes the commands to be excuted in order with each cell  
- Good to share these Notebook in Web
